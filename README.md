Hello everyone! Welcome to my automation tester project, which I am passionately implementing at the Kodilla school:) This place is my first step to become an Automation Tester in Java. I am very proud of it, even though this project is only or maybe even training material. I learn a lot here, try to understand and practice.
I have had an account on github since 2020, but my fascination with the IT world dates back to 2009, when I was dealing with Delphi and Lazarus programming environments during my studies at the University of Technology.
In the future, you can expect more projects here, both simple and small, as well as larger and more complex ones. Naturally, there will be more of the former at the beginning :)
I use the following to learn:
*GIT
*Java 21 + the latest Gradle
*IntelliJ IDEA Community version
*Postman free version
*MySQL
*Computer with Windows 10
*Laptop with Linux Mint XFCE
*Motivation, willingness, enthusiasm, commitment

That's all for now, bye! :)
